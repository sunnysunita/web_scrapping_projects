Our job is to create and enable routing solutions for our products and customers. We are looking for a backend-focused engineer to join our great squad. The main programming languages we use are Java 8 and Javascript ES6, but we believe that continuous learning is essential in an ever-changing and fast-paced technological environment.</p>\\n<p>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US\\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 280 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.</p>\\n<p>HOW THE ROLE WORKS\\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions. With us you will use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\\n<p>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO\\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as the best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it).</p>\\n<p>\\u2022\\u00a0You design, implement, scale and monitor our routing backend which provides vehicle, public transport and intermodal directions for our mobility apps and platform\\n\\u2022\\u00a0You implement routing algorithms in Java\\n\\u2022\\u00a0You design and provide APIs around our routing services\\n\\u2022\\u00a0You are involved in building infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our routing engine\\n\\u2022\\u00a0You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions\\n\\u2022\\u00a0You collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features</p>\\n<p>ABOUT YOU\\nYou should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging Java code and should be concerned about clean, high quality and maintainable code. Graph theory and routing algorithms are well known to you. Also, vehicle routing problems (VRP) are no strangers to you or at least something you always wanted to learn more about and master. You have experience with and are open to get deep into OSM and GTFS data formats. Some exposure to service based architectures would be useful. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud computing. As it is our corporate language, you should have good writing and verbal communication skills in English.</p>\\n<p>BENEFITS</p>\\n<p>\\u2022\\u00a0Choose your own hardware\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Company pension plan\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Free breakfast, coffee &amp; water\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Mobility allowance\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Working on products with a high impact on society\\n\\u2022\\u00a0International teams\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Child care allowance\\n\\u2022\\u00a0Flexible working hours</p>\\n<p>You bring what we are looking for?

Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.</p>\\n<h3>The kind of stuff you\\u2019ll be doing:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Developing new visualization features</strong> for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you're responsible for.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Building &amp; maintaining integrations</strong> with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS\\u2019s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Extending Datawrapper</strong> to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don\\u2019t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Who we\\u2019re looking for:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We\\u2019re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, <strong>preferrably full-time</strong>, but open to flexible work time arrangements.</li>\\n<li>You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will <strong>not be possible to do this job entirely remote</strong>. <em>Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.</em>\\n</li>\\n<li>On the technical side, most of the work we\\u2019re doing is front end development work in <strong>JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and <a href=\\\"https://svelte.technology/\\\">Svelte</a></strong>. There\\u2019s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won\\u2019t be too much of your concern.</li>\\n<li>We\\u2019re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. <strong>We\\u2019re happy to show you how our stack works.</strong>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>What the \\\"client-facing\\\" part entails:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A significant part of the job will involve <strong>interacting with users and customers.</strong> be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent</li>\\n<li>That means we're looking for someone with <strong>good communication, interpersonal and written skills</strong>.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Strong English skills</strong> will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.</li>\\n<li>Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.</li>\\n<li>If you have <strong>any prior work you can show us</strong>, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don\\u2019t, please don\\u2019t feel discouraged to apply.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>What we can offer:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg</strong>, where seven of us work (<a href=\\\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/about-us/\\\">Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans &amp; David</a>). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse &amp; interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Flexible working hours.</strong> We're looking for someone who wants to work for us <strong>at least four days a week</strong>. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere.</strong> We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We don't care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don't find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway. Talk a bit about yourself and how your skills &amp; experience could be a good fit for this job, and ask us aaaaall the questions you might have:</p>\\n<p><strong>\\u2192 <a href=\\\"mailto:lisa@datawrapper.de\\\">lisa@datawrapper.de</a></strong></p>\\n<p>We're looking forward to hearing from you!</p>\\n\",\n",
